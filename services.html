         <h1 class="page-title">GHOSTWRITING</h1>
         <h5>Who is a ghost/ghostwriter?
</h5>
<p>A ghost/ghostwriter is a professional writer who has the skills, talent and ability to write a book you would have loved to write but do not have the time or skills to do so. The ghost goes through the pain of writing for you, and charges you for it.
</p> 

<h5>How does it work?</h5>
<p>Ghostwriting, like any other job comes with a well-defined structure and plan. When an individual contacts a ghost regarding his/her book idea, the ghost and the said individual (client) decide on a date to sit to discuss the details of the idea. 
</p>
<P>Information the ghost will need to write the book is recorded to design the first draft. The ghost then sends the draft to the client for it to be reviewed and checked to ensure the ghost is on the right path regarding the idea. 
</P>
   <P>The client then makes known to the ghost areas he/she is going wrong for the ghost to make the needed changes and corrections. At this point, the ghost gives the client an opportunity to make available any other information he/she forgot to tell him/her (the ghost) during the first meeting. 
</P>      
<P>After all issues have been cleared, the ghost then leaves to design a final draft for the project. He follows it up with the contract details, project cost and deadline. After all documents have been signed, the ghost continues working on the project with his team until the work has been completed.</P>         
<h5>Why Choose Us?</h5>
<p>We are simply the best when it comes to ghostwriting. We have the mind, character and experience to turn your ideas into a great book. Our team of professionals have great expertise in writing books, speeches, memoirs, autobiography and thesis (research work). They are the best in their respective field of writing. 
</p>
         <P>We wouldn’t just choose anyone to write your book, we would choose the writer with the right skills to write your book. We have a pool of writers who have been trained to write on topic basis. Normally, writers have the area that they love to write about. If you let them write about topics they are not conversant with, they would perform abysmally. As a company, we do know what that means – choose the right people for the job. We will assign your book to a writer who has the ability to make your book a bestseller.
         </P>

<h5>What Service Will You Give To Me?
</h5>
<p>We know what it means to have an idea but not know how to put it into writing. Our ghostwriters have properly been trained to fill this great vacuum. The only thing we would need from you is to know your idea, the rest will be our part to play. We will give you a complete book sure to appeal to book lovers. There is no need going through the stress of writing your own book, we are here to help you with that. 
</p>


<h5>Our Writing Process
</h5>
         <h6>Interviews and Recordings</h6>
<p>We will have a one-on-one discussion with you to know your story/idea. This section normally takes 3-6 hours or more, depending on the scope of the book. We will ask all the questions there is to ask. Take all the materials there is to take. The information we do receive from you will guide us through the writing process. All scenes, characters, plot points and themes (emotions) will be collected. 
</p>
         <p>The story has to be complete enough. It has to be what you would have written if you had the means to. We recommend that you make known to us every detail about the idea during this section. Withholding any form of information from us can sometimes slow the whole process. Every information you do give to us would count.
</p>
         <p>As a company, we stand for quality. We stand for the very best. Therefore, our probing is just to get the best for you.
</p>

<h6>Setting Deadlines And Timelines</h6>
<p>After recording and taking all the necessary data about your idea, we will let you know – the time it will take to execute the project, the cost parameter of the project and the general outlook of the project. A non-fiction book of 30,000 to 45,000 words should take us a period of 4 to 5 months to complete if every information and support we need to do our job has been received. 
</p>
<p>After setting deadlines and agreeing on every term of the project, our company would sign a formal contract and a non-disclosure form with you.
</p>
<h6>Research And Planning
</h6>
<p>After signing all the necessary document, we will spend some few days researching and designing the first draft of your book. Upon completing it, a copy would be presented to you for the necessary corrections and adjustment to take place. Once you are satisfied with it, a final version would be designed to continue the work.
</p>
         <h6>Ghostwriting Your Book</h6>
         <p>After you have approved the second draft, our professional ghostwriter will work on the content of your book to ensure the book gets to the standard you want. He will ensure your ideas find their place in the book. 
</p>
         <p>The completed book will then be forwarded to the editors for the necessary corrections and editing to begin. (Note: feedbacks of the work would be sent to you twice before the book gets completed.)
</p>
         <h6>Revisions And Editing
</h6>
         <p>Once the writing has been completed, our professional editors will also begin their work. They will work together to ensure the manuscript is error free. They will edit, probe and proofread the book to ensure everything is on point. 
</p>
         <p>After the first group of editors have finished their job, they would forward the book to the chief editor for him to probe the book further to ensure it meets acceptable standard. After the chief editor has crossed checked the book, he will forward it to the formatting team for formatting to begin.
</p>
         <h6>Comprehensive Formatting</h6>
         <p>Our formatting team will continue the work from where the editors stopped. They will format the book to ensure everything about it looks great and perfect. When they are done formatting the book, it will be sent to the project coordinator for it to be reviewed, analyzed and approved. 
</p>
         <p>When the coordinator is satisfied with the work that has been done, he will approve the book and alert the client about the final work.
</p>
         <h6>Publishing, Promotion And Distribution
</h6>
         <p>Once the client has crossed checked the book and is satisfied with it, the project coordinator will alert him/her on the next step to take. That is, publishing the book. 
</p>
         <p>The client will have the option of self-publishing the book with us or publishing the book elsewhere. We have in place proper methods we use to publish, promote and distribute our client’s books. 
</p>
         <h5>How Do You Price Your Customers?</h5>
         <p>We don’t actually have a fixed price for writing a book. We determine the price of a book based on its scope and details. But one thing we don’t do for sure, is overpricing our clients.
</p>
         <h5>Why Choose A Professional Ghostwriter For Your Book Idea?</h5>
         <p>When it comes to writing, we all know how to write but when it comes to writing to impact lives and to make money, it is expedient to leave that to the professionals. Professionals are not called professionals for the sake of it, they are called professionals because they do things an amateur wouldn’t do. 
</p>
         <p>When it comes to writing, there are thousand and one reasons you have to choose a professional. You cannot wake up and start writing, you have to be enthused and inspired to write. In fact, you have to know what you are doing before you put a pen to a paper. 
</p>
         <p>Many people write, but less people make an impact with their writings. This is what our professional writers have been trained to do. To write to make an impact. They are not just writers, they are professionals who know how to make a book a bestseller. Professionals who know where to hit hard to make you successful. 
</p>
         <p>If you consider expensive hiring a professional for a job, then try hiring an amateur. We are professionals because we do what we do really well.
</p>
         <h5>Do You Write For A Share Of The Royalties?
</h5>
         <p>The answer to this question is a No. We do not work to take royalties. This is because, we consider that, that which belongs to the client (employer) has to be his to enjoy and that which belongs to the labourer (employee) has to be his to enjoy. 
</p>
         <p>Taking advantage of that which belongs to any of the two parties is pure cheating. Therefore, we believe that none of the two parties should try to take advantage of the other. This is why we don’t take royalties – to ensure we don’t take advantage of you.
</p>
         <h5>Contract/ Non-Disclosure Terms</h5>
         <p>As a company, we believe in protecting the integrity of those we work with. We do know that letting someone write a book for you can sometimes not be an easy choice to make. We understand the risk component of this work. Therefore, we ensure a contract is signed between the two parties before any kind of work is done. 
</p>
         <h5>
Terms of Payment
</h5>
         <p>Generally, we require our clients to make an upfront deposit of 40 to 60% of the total cost before the whole project begins. The remaining amount is then paid in an installment basis as the project progresses. 
</p>
         <p>We are not really rigid on this terms because we are a flexible company. We are open to dialogue with our clients to satisfy their needs. Sometimes, based on our client’s need, we do alter this terms to suite them.
